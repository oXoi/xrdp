.SH "NAME"
\fBxrdp-km.toml\fR \- \fBxrdp\fP key mapping file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Key mapping files are located at \fB@sysconfdir@/@sysconfsubdir@/km-XXXXXXXX.toml\fP
where \fBXXXXXXXX\fP is the input locale identifier sent by the RDP client.

The key mapping files are used to translate RDP scan codes into one of
the following forms:-
.TP
.B X11 KeySyms
These are used when \fBxrdp\fP connects to a VNC server.
.TP
.B Unicode characters
These are used on the \fBxrdp\fP login screen.
.RE
.PP
Each keymap file consists of several sections. Each section starts with
the section name in square brackets, followed by a list of
\fIparameter\fR=\fIvalue\fR lines.

.SH "SECTIONS"
The following sections are recognized:
.TP
\fB[Globals]\fR
Global configuration

.TP
\fB[noshift]\fR
Key mappings if no modifier keys (i.e. shift, alt gr, caps lock) are down.
.TP
\fB[shift]\fR
Key mappings if the shift key is down.
.TP
\fB[altgr]\fR
Key mappings if the alt gr key is down.
.TP
\fB[shiftaltgr]\fR
Key mappings if the shift and alt gr keys are down.
.TP
\fB[capslock]\fR
Key mappings if the caps lock key is down.
.TP
\fB[shiftcapslock]\fR
Key mappings if the caps lock and shift keys are down.
.TP
\fB[shiftcapslockaltgr]\fR
Key mappings if the shift, caps lock and alt gr keys are down.
.TP
\fB[numlock]\fR
Key mappings if the numlock key is down.

.LP
All parameters and values are case
insensitive, and are described in detail below. If any parameter is
specified more than once, the last entry will be used. Options specified
outside their proper section will be \fIignored\fR.

.SH "GLOBALS Section"
Following parameters can be used in the \fB[Globals]\fR section.

.TP
\fBVersion\fR=\fInumber\fR
Version of the file format in use.
Can be used to check for file format mis-matches when a file is loaded.
.RE

.SH "Keymap Sections"
All other sections contain lines formatted in one of the following
ways:-

.TP
<scancode>=<KeySym>
.TP
<scancode>=<KeySymNum>:<unicode-char>
.RE

Each line may also be followed by a comment (preceded by '#') which
contains more information about the key, for example a KeySym string.

.TP
.B scancode
A \fBscancode\fP is an RDP scancode received from the client. These
correspond to Windows "Scan Code Set 1" scan codes, and can be displayed
in Windows by using an appropriate utility.

The \fBscancode\fP is in one of these two forms:-

.RS 8
.TP
.B <hex-digit><hex-digit>
Standard scancodes. For example, '1C' refers to the enter key.
These are 'key down' scancodes, and so are always between 00 and 7F.
.TP
.B E0_<hex-digit><hex-digit>
Extended scancodes. For example, 'E0_1C' refers to the enter key on the numeric keypad.
.RE

.TP
.B KeySymNum
A decimal number representing an X11 KeySym

.TP
.B unicode-char
A string of the format \fBU+XXXX\fP \fBU+XXXXX\fP,, \fBU+XXXXX\fP,
where \fBX\fP is a hexadecimal digit.
.RE

.SH "Limitations"
This file format has the following limitations.
.IP \(bu
Not all combinations of shift keys are stored in the file. For example,
at present there is no section for shift and numlock combined.
.IP \(bu
Modifier keys, other than the ones supported above, are not supported.
